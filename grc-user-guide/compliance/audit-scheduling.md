# GRC Audit Scheduling

## Introduction

## Audit Schedule

The Audit Schedule is a visual calendar of all the audits that have been created and scheduled. This lets you keep track of any upcoming audits

* **All Audits**

Displays all audits in the calendar view.

* **That I Own**

Displays only the audits that you own.

* **Where I am the Auditor**

Displays only the audits where you have been set as the auditor

Selecting a scheduled audit within the calendar will display the details of that audit within the right hand side. From there items are linked to the original records to allow you to easily navigate to the Audit or Audit Register associated to the entry.
